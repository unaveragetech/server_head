# Multi-Instance Flask Web Server

This project provides a multi-instance Flask web server that allows users to serve HTML files from their local machine. The server includes a web interface for user authentication, file management, and logging. Users can upload files, check server status, and restart their server instances based on their assigned roles.

## Features

- **Multi-Instance Support**: Spin up multiple Flask server instances on different ports.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three user roles with different permissions:
  - **User**: Can view and manage their own files.
  - **Admin**: Can upload files and check server status.
  - **Superuser**: Can restart servers and perform all admin tasks.
- **File Management**: Users can upload HTML files to the server's designated directory.
- **Logging**: Each server instance maintains a log of interactions for monitoring purposes.
```
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unaveragetech/server_head.git
   cd server_head
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   This project requires Flask and Flask-Login. The script will automatically install these packages if they are not present:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

3. **Verify the installation**: 
   Ensure that Flask and Flask-Login are installed correctly by checking the output during the initial run.

## Usage

1. **Run the server manager**:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

2. **Open a web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:<port>/login
   ```
   Replace `<port>` with the port number assigned to your server instance (e.g., `5001`, `5002`, etc.).

3. **Log in** using one of the following accounts:
   - Admin: `admin` / `admin_password`
   - Superuser: `superuser` / `superuser_password`
   - User: `user` / `user_password`

4. **Manage your server** from the admin panel:
   - Upload files to the server.
   - Check the server status.
   - Restart the server (superuser only).

## Configuration

You can modify user credentials and server settings directly in the script:

- **Users**: Change the `users` dictionary to add or modify user accounts, passwords, roles, and instance names.
- **Secret Key**: Adjust the `secret_key` for session management to enhance security.
- **Port Assignment**: The script assigns unique ports starting from `5001`. Adjust this as needed for your environment.

## User Roles and Permissions

- **User**: 
  - Can upload files to their instance.
  - Can view their own files.
- **Admin**:
  - Can upload files.
  - Can check server status.
  - Cannot restart the server.
- **Superuser**:
  - All admin permissions.
  - Can restart the server.

## File Management

- Users can upload HTML files through the web interface.
- Uploaded files are stored in a designated directory for each server instance (`server_<id>/html_files`).
- Users must have appropriate roles to perform file uploads.

## Logging

- Each server instance maintains a log file named `server_<id>.log`.
- Logs record significant events, including file uploads and server status checks, helping with monitoring and debugging.
